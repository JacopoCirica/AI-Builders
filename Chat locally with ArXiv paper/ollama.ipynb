      "\n",
      "**Overall Concept:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The image represents a simplified model used for causal language modeling. Causal language models are designed to predict the next word in a sequence, considering only the words that came before it. This is in contrast to autoregressive models which consider the entire sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Components and Flow:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Input Prompt:**  The input prompt - in this case, \"is\" - is represented as a series of colored blocks (PAD - padding).  The diagram is illustrating how the model receives the input sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **LLM (Large Language Model):** This is the core component. It's depicted as a large square grid.  This represents the layers of the neural network responsible for processing the input sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hidden States:**  The circles within the LLM represent \"hidden states.\" These are the intermediate representations that the model creates at each step during the processing of the input. Each hidden state captures some aspect of the context derived from the preceding words.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Language Modeling Head (Linear Layer):** The square-shaped component to the right of the LLM is the \"language modeling head.\" It's a linear layer that takes the hidden states and converts them into prediction scores. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Predictions:** The blue arrows representing the predictions.  This is the output of the language modeling head.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Sequence Size:** At the output is \"Sequence size\".\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Idea:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram illustrates the core process: The model receives a sequence (padded with PADs), processes it through the LLM to create hidden states, and then uses these hidden states to generate predictions for the next word in the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this diagram!"

To address these\\nlimitations, the Mamba architecture utilizes state-space models\\n(SSMs) for linear scalability, efficient processing, and improved\\ncontextual awareness. This paper investigates Mamba architec-\\nture for visual domain applications and its recent advancements,\\nincluding Vision Mamba (ViM) and VideoMamba, which in-\\ntroduce bidirectional scanning, selective scanning mechanisms,\\nand spatiotemporal processing to enhance image and video un-\\nderstanding.

INTRODUCTION\\nDeep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI),\\nand has been instrumental in advancing computer vision,\\nsignificantly enhancing machines’ ability to interpret and\\nunderstand visual information from the world. By harness-\\ning the power of neural networks, particularly Convolutional\\nNeural Networks (CNNs) [1], [2] and, more recently, Vision\\nTransformers (ViTs) [3]–[5], deep learning has enabled the\\ndevelopment of complex, highly accurate models for tasks\\nsuch as image classification [6], object detection [7], semantic\\nsegmentation [8], [9], and spatio-temporal video understand-\\ning. [10], [11]. Transformers, originally popularized in natural\\nlanguage processing (NLP) [4], have shown significant poten-\\ntial in vision tasks. Architectures such as Vision Transformers\\n(ViTs) [5] and hybrid models [12], [13] leverage their ability\\nto capture complex dependencies, delivering state-of-the-art\\nresults.\\nAt the core of these advances are models with massive\\nparameter counts capable of capturing intricate patterns in\\ndata. Transformers despite their success, face challenges due\\nto the quadratic complexity of attention calculations, resulting\\nin time-consuming inference. Mamba, a novel architecture\\ninspired by state-space models (SSMs), presents a promising\\nalternative for building foundation models [14]. With near-\\nlinear scalability in sequence length and hardware-efficient\\nprocessing, Mamba has been recently adapted to computer vi-\\nsion tasks, including image and video processing. Models like\\nVision Mamba (ViM) [15] and VideoMamba [16] demonstrate\\nMamba’s ability to handle long-range dependencies while\\naddressing the computational and memory bottlenecks faced\\nby Transformer-based models in the visual domain.\\nThis paper offers a comprehensive review of Mamba archi-\\ntectures applied to visual tasks, highlighting their similarities,\\ndifferences, and effectiveness in addressing various challenges.\\nOur survey exclusively focuses on Mamba’s role in visual\\ntasks, setting it apart from broader Mamba surveys that cover\\napplications in text, recommendation systems, and medical\\nimaging [17]–[20]. While previous works like [21], [22]\\nexamine Mamba in vision, this paper uniquely focuses on\\nViM and VideoMamba as core models. We assess architec-\\ntural enhancements, including position embeddings, cross-scan\\nmodules, and hierarchical designs, to provide new insights into\\noptimizing Mamba for both local and global feature extraction.\\nAdditionally, we offer a comparative performance analysis\\nacross image classification, semantic segmentation, and object\\ndetection, giving practical recommendations for selecting the\\nbest architectures for various vision tasks. This task-specific\\ncomparison sets our work apart from general Mamba surveys\\nand provides valuable guidance for vision-based research.\\nThe rest of this survey is organized as follows: Section II\\nprovides an introductory overview of the building blocks of\\nViM and the theoretical foundations of SSMs. Section III\\ncompares ViM and Video Mamba. Section IV reviews recent\\nadvancements in Mamba architectures. Section V presents a\\nperformance comparison and analysis of the novel architec-\\ntures on common datasets. Section VI discusses the challenges\\nassociated with ViM and its applications. Finally, the paper is\\nconcluded in Section VII.\\nII. PRELIMINARY\\nA.

Using step size ∆,\\nthe continuous system parameters A, B are converted to ¯A, ¯B\\nas\\n¯A = exp(∆A),\\n¯B = (∆A)−1(exp(∆A) −I) · ∆B.\\n(2)\\nand the discretized system equation can be represented as\\nht = ¯Aht−1 + ¯Bxt,\\nyt = Cht\\n(3)\\nB. Selective Scanning Mechanism\\nTraditional SSMs struggle with maintaining context aware-\\nness in dense text and data. Mamba introduces a selection\\nmechanism that dynamically adapts to input data, filtering ir-\\nrelevant information while retaining relevant data indefinitely.\\nMamba’s innovation lies in the Selective Scan Mechanism (S6)\\n[14], making SSM parameters B, C, ∆functions of the input\\nas SB(x), SC(x), S∆(x). This is achieved through a linear\\ntransformation\\nB, C, ∆= Linear(x)\\nwhere B, C, ∆∈RB×L×N, L denotes the input sequence\\nlength, B is the batch size, and D denotes the number of\\nchannels.\\nThe original Mamba block [14] introduced a hardware-\\naware algorithm to efficiently compute the selective SSM\\nparameters. These parameters are used in SSM equations\\nEq. (1) and Eq. (3) to compute the latent hidden state and\\noutput.

Vision Mamba (ViM) Block\\nVision Mamba extends the Mamba architecture to address\\nthe complexities of visual data. It tackles position sensitivity\\nby incorporating position embeddings, similar to those used in\\nViT [5]. To capture global context, ViM employs bidirectional\\nSSMs, as illustrated in Fig. 2, allowing each sequence element\\nto access information from both preceding and succeeding\\nelements [15].\\nD. Bidirectional/Spatiotemporal Scanning\\nThe original Mamba block’s unidirectional scanning suits\\ncausal sequences. However, visual data is non-causal. ViM\\nemploys bidirectional scanning, processing sequences forward\\nand backward to capture dependencies effectively, as shown\\nin Fig. 2. For video understanding, spatiotemporal scanning\\nextends this concept. VideoMamba employs 3D bidirectional\\nblocks to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, as shown\\nin Fig. 3. In addition to these strategies, researchers have\\nexplored various spatiotemporal methods, such as spatial-\\nfirst versus temporal-first scanning, as well as sweeping scan,\\ncontinuous scan, and local scan techniques, to further enhance\\nViM’s performance and efficiency. An overview of how these\\nmethods are utilized in key architectures is presented in\\nSection IV.\\nIII. VISION MAMBA VS.

Vision Mamba (ViM)\\nThe ViM block as shown in Fig. 4(a) is an adaptation of\\nthe Mamba block designed to process visual data using bidi-\\nrectional scanning/sequence modeling. Unlike the original\\nunidirectional Mamba block the ViM block processes flattened\\nvisual sequences with simultaneous forward and backward\\nSSMs to capture spatial context. The input sequence is gen-\\nerated by transforming the 2D image into flattened 2D image\\npatches with the addition of both position embeddings and\\nclass tokens; the latter represents the whole patch sequence.\\nThe normalized sequence input is linearly projected to\\nproduce two transformed representations: x (used for main\\nprocessing) and z (used later for gating). The x transformed\\nrepresentation is processed in both forward and backward\\ndirections (similar to bidirectional RNNs or Transformers). For\\neach direction:\\n• A 1D convolution is applied to x, followed by a SiLU\\nactivation, producing x′\\no; represented by the ”Forward\\nConv1d and Backward Conv1d” blocks in Fig. 4(a).\\n• Within the SSM blocks, three separate linear projections\\ntransform x′\\no into: Bo, Co, ∆o.\\n• The scaling factor ∆o is applied to transform Ao, Bo:\\n3\\n¯\\nAo = exp(∆oAo),\\n¯\\nBo = (∆oAo)−1(exp(∆oAo) −I) · ∆oBo.\\n(6)\\n• The SSM then computes forward-scanned (yforward and\\nbackward-scanned ybackward) output features, which are\\ngated and averaged to produce the output.\\nThe outputs (yforward and ybackward) are modulated using\\nSiLU activations applied to z; This acts as a gating mecha-\\nnism, controlling the contribution of each direction. The gated\\noutputs are added together and passed through a final linear\\ntransformation, where a residual connection (adding back\\nthe original normalized sequence input ensures that useful\\noriginal information is retained.\\nThis bidirectional processing is a key difference from the\\noriginal Mamba block, allowing the ViM block to consider the\\ncontext from both past and future tokens, as image data is in-\\nherently non-causal, and a token in a future sequence segment\\nmay have significant relevance to the context of the currently\\nassessed image token. The ViM block incorporates position\\nembeddings to preserve spatial information, addressing the\\noriginal Mamba’s lack of spatial awareness as it was designed\\nfor 1D sequences. Additionally, parameters are shared for\\nboth forward and backward scanning directions within the\\nViM block. By incorporating bidirectional SSMs and position\\nembeddings, ViM and all of its variants aim to achieve com-\\nparable modeling power to Transformers while maintaining a\\nlinear memory complexity and efficiently compressing visual\\nrepresentations, making it suitable for various vision tasks.\\nWhile effective, ViM faces the following unique limitations:\\n• Presence of Artifacts: One study reveals that ViM feature\\nmaps can contain artifacts, potentially impacting perfor-\\nmance [25]. These artifacts necessitate further refine-\\nments to the architecture for optimal results.\\n• Mitigating Artifacts with Mamba®: To address artifacts,\\nresearchers propose Mamba®, which strategically incor-\\nporates ”register tokens” evenly distributed throughout\\nthe token sequence. These tokens are then concatenated\\nat the end of the network to generate a comprehensive\\nimage representation. Mamba® effectively reduces arti-\\nfacts, sharpens the model’s focus on semantically relevant\\nimage areas, and surpasses previous models in accuracy\\nand scalability [25].\\n• Limited global and local representations concurrently:\\nResearchers have noted that the unidirectional nature of\\ntraditional Vision Mamba architectures can limit their\\nability to effectively capture global representations, po-\\ntentially reducing performance in tasks requiring com-\\nprehensive spatial context. [26], [27].\\nThere have been several ViM variations designed to address\\nthese specific challenges and more to enhance performance\\nacross various tasks:\\n• Vmamba: This model introduces the Cross-Scan Module\\n(CSM) to specifically address the two-dimensional nature\\nof images. By considering spatial relationships on a 2D\\nplane as other models have also done [28], Vmamba aims\\nto improve the efficiency of visual processing [24].\\n• LocalMamba and EfficientVMamba: These variations fo-\\ncus on optimizing scanning strategies within the Mamba\\narchitecture. LocalMamba employs window scanning\\nand dynamic scanning directions [27], while EfficientV-\\nMamba integrates atrous-based selective scanning and\\ndual-pathway modules for efficient global and local fea-\\nture extraction [29].\\n• VSSD Mamba: This model addresses the fundamental\\nchallenge of adapting the causal nature of traditional\\nSSD/SSM architectures to inherently non-causal vision\\ntasks [30]. It overcomes this by disregarding the magni-\\ntude of interactions between hidden states and tokens,\\nretaining only their relative weights. This technique,\\nalong with multi-scan strategies, enables the non-causal\\nintegration of scanning results, significantly improving\\nperformance in vision applications [26].\\nB. Video Mamba\\nVideoMamba is designed specifically for video understand-\\ning, addressing the challenges of local redundancy and global\\ndependencies in video data. It extends the ViM block for\\n3D video sequences, incorporating a bidirectional Mamba\\nblock, and employs various scanning methods, such as Spatial-\\nFirst, Temporal-First, and Spatiotemporal scans, to effec-\\ntively process spatiotemporal information, as illustrated in\\nFig. 3. The model incorporates a linear-complexity operator\\nto handle long-term dependencies efficiently and includes self-\\ndistillation, where a smaller model acts as a teacher, guiding\\nthe training of the larger model to improve scalability.\\nVideoMamba [16] extracts key frames from videos and\\nprocesses them as continuous input sequences. However, its\\nperformance on video benchmarks falls short of transformer-\\nbased methods, indicating room for improvement [31]. Build-\\ning upon VideoMamba, [32] addresses the limitations of “his-\\ntorical decay” and “element contradiction”. Masked backward\\ncomputation mitigates the historical decay issue, allowing\\nthe network to better handle historical tokens. Extensions of\\nVideoMamba models [32], [33] implement residual connec-\\ntions to refine the representation of similarity between tokens.\\nThese enhancements significantly boost VideoMamba’s perfor-\\nmance on video action recognition benchmarks, establishing\\nit as a strong competitor to transformer models.\\nWhile both models leverage bidirectional SSMs, Video-\\nMamba extends this capability to spatiotemporal processing\\nand incorporates distinct scanning methods, masked modeling\\nstrategies, and self-distillation for enhanced performance.\\nThe architectures of two VideoMamba models are de-\\npicted in Fig. 5. VideoMamba and its refined variants have\\nbeen tested against video transformer architectures on tasks\\nsuch as action recognition, video understanding, and multi-\\nmodal tasks [16]. A comparative efficiency analysis between\\nVideoMamba and transformer-based models reveals significant\\nimprovements in scalability and performance.

Both employ similar architectures while (a) is\\nthe same as [15] adapted for 3D data, (b) uses the concept of\\nresidual SSM and masked patches in the backward direction\\nto improve on the architecture in (a).\\nvideos with a large number of frames, making Mamba a\\nparticularly attractive choice for high-volume video processing\\napplications.\\nC. Comparison\\nViM [15] and VideoMamba [16] both adapt the Mamba\\nstate space model (SSM) [14] for visual tasks. ViM serves as\\na generic vision backbone designed to replace traditional con-\\nvolutional and attention-based networks [4]. It processes im-\\nages as sequences of patches, utilizing bidirectional scanning\\nto efficiently capture spatial context. ViM normalizes input\\ntokens, applies linear projections, and employs a bidirectional\\nSSM with position embeddings to enhance spatial information\\nrepresentation.\\nVideoMamba extends ViM to 3D video sequences, incor-\\nporating multiple scanning methods, including spatial-first,\\ntemporal-first, and spatiotemporal scanning. Unlike ViM, it\\nfollows a pure SSM-based architecture similar to the vanilla\\nViT [5], without the use of downsampling layers. VideoMamba\\nalso introduces a linear-complexity operator to effectively\\nmodel long-term dependencies, making it particularly suitable\\nfor processing spatiotemporal data in video tasks. Both models\\nhave been evaluated on tasks like image classification [35],\\nobject detection [36], semantic segmentation [37]–[39], and\\nmany other vision tasks [34], [40].\\nIn essence, ViM serves as a general-purpose image process-\\ning backbone, while VideoMamba is specifically tailored for\\nefficient video understanding, with architectural adjustments\\ndesigned to address the unique characteristics and challenges\\nof their respective data types and tasks.\\nIV. KEY ARCHITECTURES\\nThis section summarizes the recent advancements in Vi-\\nsion/Video Mamba-based studies from the perspectives of key\\narchitectural innovations.

Local Scan\\n(c) divides an image into local segments for improved local\\nrepresentation. Scans shown in (d) and (e) are not commonly\\nused scanning mechanisms but are efficient alternatives to (a)\\nand (b).\\nscan mechanisms employed by the architecture variants de-\\nscribed below. Each novel scanning strategy has been config-\\nured to supplement using Mamba for 2D and 3D applications,\\nsuch as spatial relationship modeling, limited local repre-\\nsentations, and varying directional scanning for better visual\\ncontextual features. Fig. 4 shows visual block representations\\nof some of the key architectures used in image tasks and how\\nthese blocks compare to the original Mamba block in Fig. 1.\\na) Selective State Space Models (SSMs): This is the\\nfoundation of the Mamba architecture. SSMs, especially the S6\\nblock, offer a global receptive field and linear complexity in\\nrelation to sequence length, making them a computationally\\nefficient alternative to traditional Transformers [14], [26],\\n[29], [41]. Mamba introduces a selection mechanism, enabling\\nthe model to selectively retain or discard information based\\non the input, enhancing context-based reasoning [14], [41].\\nThis architecture enables the model to perform content-based\\nreasoning by making the SSM parameters functions of the\\ninput. This allows the models to selectively propagate or forget\\ninformation along the sequence length, filtering irrelevant\\ninformation and maintaining long-term memory of relevant\\ninformation [14], [30], [41], [42].\\nb) Multi-path Scanning Mechanisms: To overcome the\\nlimitations of Mamba’s causal nature, which is not ideal for\\nimage processing, several models like VMamba in Fig.4(b),\\nLocalMamba in Fig.4(c), and PlainMamba in Fig.4(d) have\\nadopted multi-path scanning mechanisms. This allows the\\nmodels to capture both local and global features more effec-\\ntively [15], [27], [43].\\nLocalMamba [27] improves image scanning by dividing\\nimages into distinct local windows, ensuring relevant tokens\\nare closely arranged to better capture local dependencies while\\nmaintaining spatial coherence. To incorporate global context,\\nthe method integrates a selective scan mechanism across four\\ndirections: the original two and their flipped counterparts,\\nallowing for both forward and backward token processing, as\\n5\\nshown in Fig. 6(c).\\nc) Structure-Aware SSM Layer: Introduced in Spatial-\\nMamba, this layer incorporates a Structure-Aware State Fusion\\n(SASF) branch and a multiplicative gate branch as shown in\\nFig. 4(e). This allows the model to capture both local and\\nglobal spatial dependencies [44]. Unlike previous methods that\\nrely on multiple scanning directions, Spatial-Mamba fuses the\\nstate variables into a new structure-aware state variable [44].\\nOnce an input image is flattened into 1D patches and state\\nparameters are determined, the patches are reshaped into 2D,\\nand SASF is applied to integrate local dependencies before\\ngenerating the final output.\\nd) Cross-Layer Token Fusion: Famba-V, a technique\\ndesigned to enhance the training efficiency of Vision Mamba\\n(ViM) models, incorporates three cross-layer token fusion\\nstrategies [45]–[48].\\nToken fusion is applied within the ViM block as shown\\nbefore the final linear projection operation in Fig. 4 (f), the\\ntokens are grouped and paired based on cosine similarity, and\\nfused by averaging. There are three token fusion strategies\\nimplemented in [45] with upper layer token fusion, producing\\nthe best results on vision tasks shown in Section V:\\n• Interleaved Token Fusion – Applies fusion to alternate\\nlayers, starting from the second layer, to maintain effi-\\nciency without overly aggressive fusion.\\n• Lower-layer Token Fusion – Applies fusion only to the\\nlower layers, leveraging early-stage efficiency gains while\\npreserving high-level reasoning.\\n• Upper-layer Token Fusion – Applies fusion only to upper\\nlayers, assuming high-level features can be fused without\\nsignificantly affecting performance.\\ne) Hierarchical Mamba Architecture (Hi-Mamba): This\\narchitecture in Fig. 4(g) designed for image super-resolution,\\nintroduces a hierarchical Mamba block (HMB) comprised of\\nlocal and region SSMs with single-direction scanning. This\\nsetup aims to capture multi-scale visual context efficiently\\n[49].\\nf) Direction Alternation Hierarchical Mamba Group\\n(DA-HMG): Within Hi-Mamba, this group further enhances\\nspatial relationship modeling. It allocates single-direction\\nscanning into cascaded HMBs, improving performance with-\\nout increasing computational costs or parameters [49].\\ng) Non-Causal State Space Duality (NC-SSD): Models\\nlike VSSD introduce non-causal SSD, eliminating the causal\\nmask in the state space dual model (SSD) of Mamba2 [30].\\nThis architectural innovation allows for a more flexible ap-\\nplication of Mamba to inherently non-causal data like images\\n[15], [26], [29], [50].\\nThe VSSD block [26] enhances Mamba2 SSD for vision\\ntasks by incorporating Depth-Wise Convolution (DWConv)\\n[51], a Feed-Forward Network (FFN) for better channel com-\\nmunication, and a Local Perception Unit (LPU) for improved\\nlocal feature extraction. The four-stage hierarchical VSSD\\nmodel uses VSSD blocks in the first three stages and Multi-\\nHead Self-Attention (MSA) in the last, balancing efficiency\\nand performance in vision applications [4].\\nh) Hidden State Mixer-based SSD (HSM-SSD): Effi-\\ncientViM models feature this layer, which shifts the channel\\nmixing operations from the image feature space to the hidden\\nstate space. This design aims to alleviate the computational\\nbottleneck of the standard SSD layer without compromising\\nthe model’s ability to generalize [29].\\ni) Register Tokens in Vision Mamba: Mamba® intro-\\nduces registers, input-independent tokens, into the Vision\\nMamba architecture. These tokens, inserted evenly throughout\\nthe input and recycled for final predictions, aim to mitigate\\nartifacts and enhance the model’s focus on semantically mean-\\ningful image regions [25].\\nj) Masked Backward Computation: VideoMambaPro in-\\ncorporates masked backward computation during the bidirec-\\ntional Mamba process, mitigating the issue of historical decay\\nin token processing and enabling the model to better utilize\\nhistorical information [16], [32].\\nk) Elemental Residual Connections:\\nVideoMambaPro\\nalso introduces residual connections to the matrix elements\\nof Mamba, addressing the challenge of element contradiction,\\nwhere elements in the sequence can conflict during computa-\\ntion. This enhances the model’s ability to extract and process\\ncomplex spatio-temporal features in video data [16], [32].\\nMany of these innovations focus on enhancing the effi-\\nciency and performance of Mamba-based models in vision\\ntasks, while preserving the linear complexity advantage over\\ntraditional Transformers.\\nV. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON\\nTo provide a systematic comparison of the performance of\\ndifferent models across various datasets and tasks, this section\\ncompares the results of [14]–[16], [24]–[27], [29], [30], [32],\\n[43]–[45] in common dataset benchmarks. The models shown\\nare only those of a similar size in the cases where researchers\\nprovided ‘small’, ‘base’, or ‘large’ model variations. The re-\\nsults are categorized by tasks; image classification against the\\nImagenet-1k dataset [35], [52], semantic segmentation against\\nthe ADE20K dataset [38], [53], object detection against the\\nMS-COCO dataset [54], and human action recognition for\\nvideo understanding benchmarks against both Kinetics-400\\n[55], [56] and Something-Something-V2 [57] datasets.\\nA. Image Classification\\nTable I compares various Mamba models used for image\\nclassification [10], [35] on the ImageNet-1k dataset [52],\\nemphasizing differences in scanning mechanisms, accuracy,\\nand efficiency.

Semantic Segmentation\\nTable II compares the reviewed Mamba models on the task\\nof semantic segmentation on ADE20K [37]–[39], [53]. The\\nresults show that Vmamba-S [24] and Spatial-Mamba-S (50.6\\nmIoU) [44] achieve the best performance, leveraging cross-\\nscan and Structure-Aware State Fusion, though they demand\\nhigh computational costs (1028G and 992G FLOPS). Local-\\nMamba applied to Vmamba-S (50.0 mIoU, 1095G FLOPS)\\nalso performs well [27], emphasizing local scanning benefits.\\nMambaR-S (45.3 mIoU) performs the worst, showing register\\ntoken embeddings are less effective for segmentation [25].\\nVSSD-T (47.9 mIoU), although only tested with a ‘tiny’\\nversion of the model, balances accuracy and efficiency with\\nnon-causal state space duality [26].\\nThe results highlight the trade-offs between scanning mech-\\nanisms, mIoU, and efficiency (Params and FLOPS). This\\nanalysis indicates that high-performing models depend on ad-\\nvanced scanning techniques but demand considerable compu-\\ntational resources, while lighter models, such as PlainMamba-\\nL2 [43], sacrifice some accuracy for improved efficiency.\\nC. Object Detection\\nTable\\nIII evaluates object detection models [36] on MS-\\nCOCO [51], [54], comparing accuracy based on 75% over-\\nlapping bounding box with ground truth labels (APbb75) and\\nefficiency (Params and FLOPS).\\nSpatial Mamba-S (54.2 APbb75) is the best performer, bene-\\nfiting from Sweeping Scan with Structure-Aware State Fusion,\\nalthough it has high computational demands (315G FLOPS)\\n[44]. VSSD-S (53.1 APbb75) follows closely, leveraging Non-\\nCausal State Space Duality, balancing accuracy and efficiency\\n(325G FLOPS) [26]. LocalMamba applied to Vmamba-S\\n(52.7 APbb75) also performs well, emphasizing local scanning\\nadvantages [27]. The worst performer is EfficientViM-M4\\n(41.1 APbb75), which, despite its efficiency (4.1G FLOPS),\\nsacrifices accuracy in place of reduced computational cost\\n[29]. Vmamba-S (48.7 APbb75) and Vision Mamba (49.6\\nAPbb75) [15], [24], which rely on cross-scan and bidirec-\\ntional raster scanning, show moderate performance but are\\nless effective than structure-aware or local scanning methods.\\nPlainMamba-L2 (50.1 APbb75, 542G FLOPS) [43] achieves\\ndecent results but is computationally expensive. This analysis\\nhighlights that Spatial Mamba-S and VSSD-S lead in accuracy,\\nwhile EfficientViM-M4 prioritizes efficiency at the cost of\\nperformance.\\nD.

Both\\nmodels consistently perform better on Kinetics-400 than\\nSSV2. Ref.

VSSD-\\nS and LocalMamba offer a balance between accuracy and\\nefficiency across tasks.\\nVI. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE RESEARCH\\nMamba models are capable of modeling long-range depen-\\ndencies with linear complexity, making them well-suited for\\ntasks involving high-resolution images, long sequences, and\\nlarge video datasets. Techniques such as bidirectional scanning\\nand multi-scale processing further enhance Mamba’s ability\\nto capture both local and global context. Mamba is currently\\nbeing explored in specialized vision domains, such as:\\n• Scene flow estimation. FlowMamba [59] uses an iterative\\nSSM-based update module and a feature-induced order-\\ning strategy to capture long-range motion.\\n• Vein recognition. Global-local Vision Mamba (GLVM)\\ncombines local and global feature learning for enhanced\\nvein recognition [40].\\n• Medical image analysis. PV-SSM is a pure visual state\\nspace model achieving strong results across medical\\nimage analysis [60].\\n• Skin lesion segmentation. MambaU-Lite [61] combines\\nMamba and CNN architectures for efficient skin lesion\\nsegmentation, using a novel P-Mamba block.\\nFuture research aims to develop native 2D and 3D Mamba\\nmodels, non-causal state-space dual models, and efficient\\ntoken fusion techniques. Some potential directions include:\\n• Multi-modal image fusion. Shuffle Mamba employs a\\nrandom shuffle-based scanning method to mitigate biases\\nin multi-modal image fusion [62].\\n• RGB-D salient object detection. MambaSOD is a dual\\nMamba-driven network for RGB-D salient object detec-\\ntion, using cross-modal fusion to combine RGB and depth\\ninformation [63].\\n• Point cloud processing. NIMBA reorders point cloud\\ndata to maintain 3D spatial structure, enhancing Mamba’s\\nsequential processing [64]. Serialized Point Mamba [65]\\nuses a state-space model for dynamic compression of\\npoint cloud sequences for efficient segmentation.\\nCombining Mamba with CNNs and Transformers is also a\\nresearch direction to compensate for each other’s weaknesses.\\n• Object detection with YOLO. Mamba-YOLO integrates\\nMamba into the YOLO architecture, achieving improved\\nobject detection performance [66].\\n• 3D object detection. MambaBEV [42] and PillarMamba\\n[67] integrate Mamba into 3D object detection models\\nfor autonomous driving. MambaDETR is also used for\\n3D object detection [68].\\n• Point cloud enhancement. MambaTron uses Mamba for\\ncross-modal point cloud completion, combining Mamba’s\\nefficiency with Transformer’s analytical capabilities [69].\\nVideoMamba [16] still has challenges in achieving perfor-\\nmance parity with Transformers, addressing historical decay,\\nand managing potential element contradictions [70]. Future\\nresearch will focus on enhancing stability and closing the\\nperformance gap with other architectures, in order to fully\\nunlock Mamba’s potential for efficient, long-range context\\nmodeling in vision and video.\\nVII. CONCLUSION\\nThis paper provides an overview of visual Mamba, detail-\\ning their architectures, applications, and challenges. Vision\\nMamba functions as a general vision backbone, processing\\nimages as sequences of patches with bidirectional scanning\\nto effectively capture spatial context. Video Mamba extends\\nthis approach to 3D video sequences, operating across both\\nspatial and temporal dimensions. Despite significant advance-\\nments and key architectural developments, challenges persist\\nin fully realizing Mamba’s potential for vision tasks. Future re-\\nsearch should focus on refining these architectures, broadening\\nMamba’s applicability to a wider range of visual modalities,\\ndeveloping efficient token fusion techniques, and improving\\nits scalability for real-world deployment.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThis research was funded by the Natural Sciences and\\nEngineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) under\\ngrant numbers ALLRP 588173-23 and ALLRP 570580-21.\\n8\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Y.
